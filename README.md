- Creates Generation 2 VM with UEFI support
- Configures static RAM allocation (no dynamic memory)
- Sets up TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot for Windows 11
- Disables checkpoints and integration services
- Attaches ISO if provided
- Sets boot order (DVD ‚Üí HDD)

**Presets:**
- **Gaming VM**: 16GB RAM, 8 CPU, 256GB storage

**Partition Formula:**
```
MaxValue = (Percentage / 100) √ó 1,000,000,000
OptimalValue = MaxValue - 1
MinValue = 1
```

### **[3] Inject GPU Drivers**
Installs NVIDIA drivers directly into VM disk image.

**What it does:**

**Use this when:**
- You updated NVIDIA drivers on the host
- VM has driver issues or outdated drivers
- After Windows updates that affect GPU drivers

### **[6] List VMs & GPU Info**
System dashboard showing VM status and GPU information.

**Displays:**
- All Hyper-V VMs (Name, State, CPU Usage, RAM, GPU Enabled)

## üß™ Troubleshooting

### Error: "WINDOWS IS NOT INSTALLED ON THIS VM"

**Cause:** Driver injection attempted before OS installation.

**Solution:**
1. Start the VM
2. Install Windows from ISO
3. Complete setup and shut down VM
4. Run Option [3] again

---

### Error: "VM must be off"

**Cause:** VM is running or in saved state.

**Solution:**
- Script auto-shuts down VMs, but if it fails:
```powershell
Stop-VM -Name "VM-Name" -Force
```

---

### Error: "No NVIDIA drivers found on host"

**Cause:** NVIDIA drivers not installed or not in expected location.

**Solution:**
1. Install latest NVIDIA drivers from nvidia.com/drivers
2. Restart host system
3. Verify with: `nvidia-smi`

---

### Error: "Method 'Clamp' not found"

**Cause:** Running on PowerShell 5.1 or older (Windows PowerShell).

**Solution:**
- Script is already updated to use compatible methods
- If you see this error, ensure you're using the latest version of the script
- Alternative: Use PowerShell 7+ from microsoft.com/powershell

---

### Error: GPU Not Detected in VM

**Cause:** Driver injection incomplete or GPU partition not configured.

**Solution:**
1. Check Device Manager in VM ‚Üí Display Adapters
2. Should see "Microsoft Hyper-V GPU Partition Adapter"
3. If missing, re-run Option [3] (Inject GPU Drivers)
4. If "Generic Non-PnP Monitor", disable Hyper-V display adapter
5. Restart VM

---

### Performance: Low FPS or Stuttering

**Causes & Solutions:**

**1. Insufficient GPU Allocation**
- Increase GPU percentage (Option [2])
- Recommended: 50% for single VM, 40% each for two VMs

**2. Dynamic Memory Enabled** (shouldn't happen with this tool)
- Verify: `Get-VMMemory -VMName "VM-Name" | Select DynamicMemoryEnabled`
- Should be: `False`

**3. Driver Mismatch**
- Update host drivers first
- Then update VM drivers (Option [5])
- Host and VM should have identical driver versions

**4. Hyper-V Display Adapter Conflict**
- In VM Device Manager, disable "Microsoft Hyper-V Video"
- Only keep "Microsoft Hyper-V GPU Partition Adapter"

---

### Issue: Can't See GPU VRAM / Shows 4GB Limit

**Cause:** Using WMI instead of nvidia-smi (AdapterRAM is 32-bit).

**Solution:**
- Script automatically uses nvidia-smi for accurate readings
- If nvidia-smi not in PATH, add: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI`
- Option [6] shows accurate VRAM via nvidia-smi

---

### Cleanup: Remove Failed VM

```powershell
# Remove VM
Remove-VM -Name "VM-Name" -Force

# Delete VHD
Remove-Item "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Virtual Hard Disks\VM-Name.vhdx" -Force
```

## üìä Performance Expectations

### GPU Performance by Allocation

| Allocation | Use Case | Expected Performance |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **25%** | Light gaming, video playback | ~25% of host GPU |
| **50%** | Single VM gaming (recommended) | ~50% of host GPU |
| **75%** | Heavy workloads, ML training | ~75% of host GPU |
| **100%** | Single VM maximum performance | ~95% of host GPU |

### Real-World Examples

**RTX 4090 (50% allocation to VM):**
- Host: Can run desktop, browse, stream
- VM: 1440p gaming at 60-144 FPS (game dependent)
- Overhead: ~5-10% performance loss vs native

**RTX 3060 Ti (50% allocation):**
- VM: 1080p gaming at 60+ FPS (AAA titles)
- Host: Basic multitasking
- Overhead: ~10-15% performance loss

---

## üîí Limitations & Known Issues

### Graphics API Support
‚úÖ **Supported:**
- DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12
- OpenGL (most versions)
- Compute workloads (CUDA, tensor)

‚ùå **Not Supported:**
- Vulkan API
- NVIDIA DLSS
- NVIDIA Reflex
- Ray tracing (limited or no support)
- Frame generation technologies

### VM Requirements
- **Generation 2 VMs only** (UEFI required)
- **NVIDIA GPUs only** (AMD not supported by this script)
- **Windows 10/11 guest OS** (Linux experimental, not documented here)
- **No nested virtualization** (VM can't run Hyper-V VMs)

### Driver Considerations
- **Same version required:** Host and VM drivers must match
- **Manual updates needed:** VM drivers don't auto-update
- **NVIDIA control panel:** Not available in VM (controlled via host)

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### VM Configuration
‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use static memory allocation (already done by script)
- Disable checkpoints for performance (already done)
- Allocate realistic GPU percentages (50% is sweet spot)
- Keep host drivers updated
- Sync VM drivers after host updates (Option [5])

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Enable dynamic memory (causes instability)
- Use Hyper-V console for gaming (use VNC/RDP instead)
- Allocate >75% GPU to VM (leaves host unstable)
- Mix driver versions between host and VM

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use NVMe storage** for VM disks
2. **Allocate enough RAM** (16GB minimum for gaming VM)
3. **Use 1:1 CPU core ratio** (8 cores = 4 host, 4 VM)
4. **Install VB-Cable** for low-latency audio in VM
5. **Use Sunshine/Moonlight** for game streaming from VM

### Driver Management
```
Host Driver Update Workflow:
1. Update NVIDIA drivers on host
2. Restart host system
3. Power off ALL VMs completely
4. Run script ‚Üí Option [5] for each VM
5. Start VMs and verify functionality
6. Check Device Manager in each VM
```

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Multiple VMs with GPU Access

**Scenario:** 2 VMs on RTX 4090

```powershell
# VM 1: Gaming-VM (40% GPU)
Select option: 2
VM Name: Gaming-VM
GPU Allocation: 40

# VM 2: Dev-VM (40% GPU)
Select option: 2
VM Name: Dev-VM
GPU Allocation: 40

# Remaining 20% for host
```

**Result:** Both VMs have GPU access simultaneously. Combined load shouldn't exceed ~80% to avoid host instability.

---

### Custom Storage Paths

By default, VHDs are stored in:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Virtual Hard Disks\
```

**To use custom path:**
- Script prompts during VM creation
- Enter full path: `D:\Hyper-V\VMs\`
- Ensure drive has sufficient space

---

### Automated ISO Mounting

During VM creation, when prompted for ISO:
```
ISO Path: C:\ISOs\Windows11.iso
```

Script automatically:
- Adds DVD drive to VM
- Mounts ISO
- Sets boot order (DVD before HDD)

To skip ISO: Press Enter when prompted.

---

### Manual GPU Tuning

Start conservative and increase:
```
Initial test: 25%
Light gaming: 35-40%
Standard gaming: 50%
Heavy workload: 60-70%
Maximum performance: 75-90%
```

Monitor host system stability at each level.

---
