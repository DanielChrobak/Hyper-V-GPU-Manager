## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Enable Hyper-V

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All -All
```

**Note:** Restart required after enabling Hyper-V.

### Step 2: Verify NVIDIA Drivers

Ensure NVIDIA GPU drivers are installed on the host:

```powershell
nvidia-smi
```

You should see your GPU model, driver version, and VRAM details.

### Step 3: Run the Script

```powershell
# Allow script execution (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run the manager (auto-elevates to Administrator if needed)
.\Unified-VM-Manager.ps1
```

## üìã Menu Options Explained

### **[1] Create New VM**
Creates a basic Hyper-V virtual machine with optimized settings.

**What it does:**
- Prompts for VM configuration (3 presets + custom option)
- Creates Generation 2 VM with UEFI support
- Configures static RAM allocation (no dynamic memory)
- Sets up TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot for Windows 11
- Disables checkpoints and integration services
- Attaches ISO if provided
- Sets boot order (DVD ‚Üí HDD)

**Presets:**
- **Gaming VM**: 16GB RAM, 8 CPU, 256GB storage
- **Dev VM**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU, 128GB storage  
- **ML VM**: 32GB RAM, 12 CPU, 512GB storage
- **Custom**: Specify your own values

### **[2] Configure GPU Partition**
Adds GPU partitioning to an existing VM.

**What it does:**
- Selects VM from existing Hyper-V machines
- Prompts for GPU allocation percentage (1-100%)
- Auto-shuts down VM if running
- Removes old GPU partition adapters
- Calculates optimal partition values (VRAM, Encode, Decode, Compute)
- Configures memory-mapped I/O space (1GB low, 32GB high)
- Enables guest-controlled cache types

**Partition Formula:**
```
MaxValue = (Percentage / 100) √ó 1,000,000,000
OptimalValue = MaxValue - 1
MinValue = 1
```

### **[3] Inject GPU Drivers**
Installs NVIDIA drivers directly into VM disk image.

**What it does:**
- Ensures VM is powered off
- Scans host for NVIDIA driver repositories
- Mounts VM virtual hard disk
- Detects Windows partition (10GB+ size)
- Verifies Windows installation exists
- Removes old NVIDIA drivers from VM
- Copies driver repositories (nv_dispi.inf_amd64*)
- Copies system files (nv*.dll, nv*.exe)
- Safe cleanup and disk unmount

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Windows must be installed in the VM before using this option.

### **[4] Complete Setup (Recommended)**
Automated workflow combining VM creation and GPU partition configuration.

**What it does:**
1. Creates VM with your chosen preset/custom config
2. Configures GPU partition with specified percentage
3. Prepares VM for OS installation

**Next Steps After:**
1. Start the VM
2. Install Windows from attached ISO
3. Complete Windows setup
4. Shut down VM
5. Use Option [3] to inject drivers

Synchronizes VM GPU drivers with host system.

**What it does:**
- Same process as Option [3]
- Overwrites existing drivers with latest from host
- Essential after host GPU driver updates
- Maintains driver version compatibility

**Use this when:**
- You updated NVIDIA drivers on the host
- VM has driver issues or outdated drivers
- After Windows updates that affect GPU drivers

### **[6] List VMs & GPU Info**
System dashboard showing VM status and GPU information.

**Displays:**
- All Hyper-V VMs (Name, State, CPU Usage, RAM, GPU Enabled)
- Host GPU model
- Driver version
- Accurate VRAM (via nvidia-smi, falls back to WMI)

# Processor
Set-VMProcessor -Count <user-specified>

# Checkpoints
Set-VM -CheckpointType Disabled -AutomaticCheckpointsEnabled $false

# Automatic Actions
Set-VM -AutomaticStopAction ShutDown -AutomaticStartAction Nothing

# Firmware

```

### GPU Partition Configuration

```powershell
# Add GPU adapter
Add-VMGpuPartitionAdapter -VMName <name>

# Configure partition values
Set-VMGpuPartitionAdapter `
    -MinPartitionVRAM 1 `
    -MaxPartitionVRAM <calculated> `
    -OptimalPartitionVRAM <calculated-1> `
    -MinPartitionEncode 1 `
    -MaxPartitionEncode <calculated> `

# Memory-mapped I/O
Set-VM -GuestControlledCacheTypes $true `
       -LowMemoryMappedIoSpace 1GB `
       -HighMemoryMappedIoSpace 32GB
```

### Driver Injection Process

**Host Driver Locations:**
```
C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\nv_dispi.inf_amd64_*
C:\Windows\System32\nv*.dll
C:\Windows\System32\nv*.exe
```

**VM Injection Targets:**
```
<MountPoint>\Windows\System32\HostDriverStore\FileRepository\
<MountPoint>\Windows\System32\
```

**Safe Mounting:**
1. Mount VHD without drive letter
2. Update disk information
3. Find partition > 10GB (Windows partition)
4. Mount to temporary path (C:\Temp\VMMount_<random>)
5. Copy drivers
6. Remove partition access path
7. Dismount VHD
8. Delete temporary mount directory

## üé® Logging System

The tool provides real-time feedback with color-coded logging:

| Level | Icon | Color | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| **INFO** | [i] | Cyan | General information and progress |
| **SUCCESS** | [+] | Green | Successful operations |
| **WARN** | [!] | Yellow | Warnings and important notices |
| **ERROR** | [X] | Red | Errors requiring attention |
| **HEADER** | [>] | Magenta | Section headers and major steps |

**Example Output:**
```
[20:15:42] [>] Initializing VM: Gaming-VM
[20:15:43] [+] VM created: Gaming-VM | RAM: 16GB | CPU: 8 | Storage: 256GB
[20:15:44] [+] Boot order configured: DVD first
[20:15:44] [+] ISO attached
[20:15:45] [>] GPU configured: 50% allocated to Gaming-VM
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Multiple VMs with GPU Access

**Scenario:** 2 VMs on RTX 4090

```powershell
# VM 1: Gaming-VM (40% GPU)
Select option: 2
VM Name: Gaming-VM
GPU Allocation: 40

# VM 2: Dev-VM (40% GPU)
Select option: 2
VM Name: Dev-VM
GPU Allocation: 40

# Remaining 20% for host
```

**Result:** Both VMs have GPU access simultaneously. Combined load shouldn't exceed ~80% to avoid host instability.

---

### Custom Storage Paths

By default, VHDs are stored in:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Virtual Hard Disks\
```

**To use custom path:**
- Script prompts during VM creation
- Enter full path: `D:\Hyper-V\VMs\`
- Ensure drive has sufficient space

---

### Automated ISO Mounting

During VM creation, when prompted for ISO:
```
ISO Path: C:\ISOs\Windows11.iso
```

Script automatically:
- Adds DVD drive to VM
- Mounts ISO
- Sets boot order (DVD before HDD)

To skip ISO: Press Enter when prompted.

---

### Manual GPU Tuning

Start conservative and increase:
```
Initial test: 25%
Light gaming: 35-40%
Standard gaming: 50%
Heavy workload: 60-70%
Maximum performance: 75-90%
```

Monitor host system stability at each level.

## üîê Security Considerations

### VM Isolation
- VMs are isolated from host by Hyper-V hypervisor
- Network traffic can be monitored via virtual switches
- File sharing requires explicit configuration

### Driver Access
- Host drivers copied to VM (read-only access)
- VM cannot modify host driver files
- HostDriverStore directory secured by Windows

### Administrator Rights
- Script requires admin for Hyper-V operations
- Auto-elevation prompts for UAC confirmation
- All operations logged with timestamps
