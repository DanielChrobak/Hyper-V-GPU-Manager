# üéÆ GPU Virtualization Manager v3.0

**Unified Hyper-V Manager with Automated GPU Partition Support**

A streamlined PowerShell tool for creating and managing Hyper-V virtual machines with integrated GPU partitioning and NVIDIA driver injection. This solution consolidates VM creation, GPU resource allocation, and driver management into a single, efficient terminal interface with an intuitive arrow-key menu system.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This tool automates the initial setup (VM creation, GPU partition configuration, baseline driver injection). Application-specific compatibility issues and DLL troubleshooting remain manual tasks - see "Known Limitations" below.

## üö® Known Limitations & Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Application Compatibility (DLL Requirements)

**What Works:**
- Basic DirectX 9/10/11/12 games and applications
- Standard NVIDIA display drivers and partition detection
- VM-to-GPU communication for graphics rendering

**What Doesn't Work / Requires Manual Setup:**
- **Missing Application DLLs** - The script copies baseline NVIDIA drivers (`nv_dispi.inf_amd64` + `nv*.dll`/`nv*.exe`), but many applications require additional libraries not included in the basic driver set:
  - CUDA runtime libraries (curand64.dll, cufft64.dll, etc.) - needed for GPU compute, ML frameworks
  - OpenCL libraries - required by some professional software
  - Application-specific vendor libraries
  - **This is the biggest source of "app won't run" issues after driver injection**

**Manual Workaround:**
If an application fails to run in the VM after driver injection, you'll need to manually identify and copy the missing DLLs from the host `C:\Windows\System32` to the VM's `C:\Windows\System32`. For CUDA-dependent apps, you may need to download the CUDA toolkit separately inside the VM.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenGL Applications - DirectX Translation Layer

**Issue:** GPU-PV translates OpenGL calls to DirectX 12 through a compatibility layer. This causes:
- **Performance degradation** in OpenGL-heavy applications
- **Rendering glitches or crashes** in certain OpenGL features
- **Incompatibility** with advanced OpenGL extensions
- **No support** for Vulkan, DLSS, or Frame Generation

**DirectX Support:** ‚úÖ Fully supported (DX9, DX10, DX11, DX12)
**OpenGL Support:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Translated through DX12 (use with caution)
**Vulkan Support:** ‚ùå Not supported
**DLSS/Frame Gen:** ‚ùå Not supported

**Recommendation:** If your primary application uses OpenGL, GPU-PV may not be the best solution. Consider GPU passthrough or native gaming on the host instead.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GPU Support - NVIDIA Only

**Supported:** ‚úÖ NVIDIA GeForce (GTX 1060 or better, 30/40/50 series recommended)
**AMD Support:** ‚ùå Not tested (driver paths are different)
**Intel Arc:** ‚ùå Not tested

The tool scans for NVIDIA drivers specifically. AMD and Intel GPU support would require different driver paths and has not been validated.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Installation Steps Still Required

**What's Automated:**
- VM creation
- GPU partition configuration
- Baseline driver injection

**What You Still Need to Do:**
1. Install Windows manually in the VM (no unattended setup yet)
2. Download and install application-specific dependencies
3. Configure VNC/RDP for remote access
4. Install games/software inside the VM
5. Troubleshoot app-specific DLL issues
6. Per-application tuning and configuration

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes from VM creation to playable setup (this tool saves ~20 minutes of driver setup)

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Multiple VMs with GPU Access

**Scenario:** 2 VMs on RTX 4090

```
VM 1: Gaming-VM
  ‚Üí Navigate to "Configure GPU Partition"
  ‚Üí Enter VM Name: Gaming-VM
  ‚Üí GPU Allocation: 40

VM 2: Dev-VM
  ‚Üí Navigate to "Configure GPU Partition"
  ‚Üí Enter VM Name: Dev-VM
  ‚Üí GPU Allocation: 40

Remaining 20% for host
```

**Result:** Both VMs have GPU access simultaneously. Combined load shouldn't exceed ~80% to avoid host instability.

---

### Custom Storage Paths

By default, VHDs are stored in:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Virtual Hard Disks\
```

**To use custom path:**
- Script prompts during VM creation
- Enter full path: `D:\Hyper-V\VMs\`
- Ensure drive has sufficient space

---

### Automated ISO Mounting

During VM creation, when prompted for ISO:
```
ISO Path: C:\ISOs\Windows11.iso
```

Script automatically:
- Adds DVD drive to VM
- Mounts ISO
- Sets boot order (DVD before HDD)

To skip ISO: Press Enter when prompted.

---

### Manual GPU Tuning

Start conservative and increase:
```
Initial test: 25%
Light gaming: 35-40%
Standard gaming: 50%
Heavy workload: 60-70%
Maximum performance: 75-90%
```

Monitor host system stability at each level.

## üìä Application Compatibility Guide

### DirectX Games (‚úÖ Well Supported)
- Most modern games using DirectX 11/12
- Good performance, few compatibility issues
- **Examples:** Call of Duty, Fortnite, Valorant, Minecraft (DX mode)

### OpenGL Applications (‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Layer)
- Runs through DX12 translation
- **May experience:** Glitches, performance drops, crashes
- **Examples:** Blender (OpenGL mode), older games, some professional CAD software
- **Recommendation:** Use DirectX version if available

### CUDA/GPU Compute (‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Manual Setup)
- Basic compute support through GPU partition
- **Requires:** Manual installation of CUDA toolkit inside VM
- **Examples:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, CuPy
- **Note:** Must copy CUDA runtime DLLs manually

### Vulkan Applications (‚ùå Not Supported)
- GPU-PV does not support Vulkan
- Consider alternative virtualization solutions

---

## üéÆ Use Cases

### Gaming VM ‚úÖ
- DirectX games work well
- 50-60% GPU allocation for good performance
- Add VNC for streaming or remote play
- **Best Games:** Modern AAA titles using DirectX

### Development VM ‚úÖ
- Unity/Unreal development (GPU accelerated)
- GPU-accelerated testing
- Isolated development environments
- **Caveat:** OpenGL-heavy workflows may struggle

### Machine Learning VM ‚ö†Ô∏è
- CUDA support works but requires manual setup
- Good for training workloads
- **Note:** Must install CUDA toolkit manually inside VM
- **Caveat:** TensorFlow/PyTorch need dependency troubleshooting

### Content Creation ‚ö†Ô∏è
- DaVinci Resolve (CUDA rendering) - manual CUDA setup required
- Blender (OpenGL issue) - use Cycles with CUDA or Eevee
- Photo editing generally works
- **Caveat:** Check application's rendering engine compatibility

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### VM Isolation
- VMs are isolated from host by Hyper-V hypervisor
- Network traffic can be monitored via virtual switches
- File sharing requires explicit configuration

### Driver Access
- Host drivers copied to VM (read-only access)
- VM cannot modify host driver files
- HostDriverStore directory secured by Windows

### Administrator Rights
- Script requires admin for Hyper-V operations
- Auto-elevation prompts for UAC confirmation
- All operations logged with timestamps

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How do I navigate the menu?**
A: Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to move between options. The selected option is highlighted with ">>" in green. Press ENTER to confirm your selection.

**Q: Why did my app crash after driver injection?**
A: Missing application-specific DLLs. Check `Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application` for DLL errors. Manually copy the missing DLL from host `C:\Windows\System32` to VM `C:\Windows\System32`.

**Q: OpenGL games are laggy/broken. What do I do?**
A: GPU-PV translates OpenGL to DirectX 12, which causes performance issues. If a DirectX version exists, use that instead. Otherwise, consider GPU passthrough.

**Q: Can I use AMD GPUs?**
A: Not tested. The driver paths are different for AMD. Community contributions welcome on GitHub.

**Q: How do I reduce setup time?**
A: Use the "Complete Setup" option and follow the preset configurations. This automates VM creation and GPU partition in one workflow.

**Q: Can I run multiple VMs simultaneously with GPU access?**
A: Yes, allocate GPU percentages totaling <80%. More than 80% combined load may cause instability.

**Q: How do I copy apps to my VM?**
A: Create a folder named "VM Apps" in the script directory, place your zip files there, then use the "Copy VM Apps to Downloads" option.

**Q: Can I change preset values after selection?**
A: No, but you can select "Custom Configuration" from the preset menu to specify exact values.
